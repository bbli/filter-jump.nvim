* [EasyMotion](https://github.com/easymotion/vim-easymotion): Causes too much screen bloat/color change + typing of "random" characters. Personally I rather type more characters but have them actually be words in my current document, as this keeps my brain more "in the flow"
* [Vim-Sneak](https://github.com/justinmk/vim-sneak): Highlighting all possible matches is good as it solves my second issue with `f` mentioned above. But doesn't provide me the option of only searching the current line, as I feel that two characters will often have too many results when searching the entire page, and so that's where something like `/` would be better
* [Aerojump](https://github.com/ripxorip/aerojump.nvim): This plugin was probably the closest thing that fit my needs for screen wide movements, except too many results/screen bloat would appear as a result of the fuzzy matching.
* Built in `/`: On the flip side, `/` forces me to type the word exactly as is, whereas most of the time I didn't care for typing out characters such as underscores. Also `/` searches the entire file, whereas I just want to jump to a location in the current window view. This is suboptimal for when `/` does find a match out of screen, as my screen will "move", which I don't want. Finally, this pollutes my search history, which is important for my workflow since I mapped `/` to fzf's Search History finder.
